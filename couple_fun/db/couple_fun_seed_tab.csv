1	physical	Knock Your Socks Off	Bernie De Koven	Waking up in the morning; going to bed at night	A new twist on “playing footsies”	First	 both partners face each other on all fours atop a large bed or blanket on the ground. (You can make up whatever starting position you want.) Next	 see who can pull the other’s socks off first. You must stay on the mattress or blanket	 or else. Or else . . . what? Well	 you could get one free tug on the rulebreaker’s sock. (Or a tickle or. . .) The winner is whoever wins two out of three matches	 or three out of five	 or really anyone who enjoys themselves.				There are of course risks of injury in any physical game. So it is always important to use common sense when playing any of these games. Be sure not to have any furniture	 sharp or hard objects	 or fragile items with you or near the bed that you could possibly hit with your head or foot	 or any other part of your body. Keep your head far enough away from the other person’s knees and feet. (Or to be 99 percent safe	 wear a helmet with a face guard.) When playing with kids older than age ten	 you might find it prudent to pair off by gender. Be sure you don’t have a bad back or any other serious bone	 muscle or internal problem. Use common sense.																										
2	physical	The Undercover Penny	Lisa Kirnin	Waking up in the morning; going to bed at night	You can bank on this game and have some fun between the sheets as well.	Two people play this game. One person throws a penny under the covers. Both scramble to find the penny	 hopefully without bumping heads. The one who finds the penny and picks it up wins! So	 what will the prize be? That depends who's playing. Best two out of three or three out of five wins whatever you decide.				Be sure not to have any furniture	 sharp or hard objects	 or fragile items near the bed that you could possibly hit with your head or foot. Be sure to keep your head far enough away from the other person’s knees and feet. Or to be 99 percent safe	 wear a helmet with a face guard. Be sure you don't have a bad back or any other serious bone	 muscular	 or internal problem. There have also been reports that sometimes this game doesn't get beyond the first penny under the covers with some couples. So	 use your own best judgment.																														
3	dramatic	Wake Up Singing	David and Joanne Kleijunas	Waking up in the morning; going to bed at night	Wake up feeling happy. Use your set of lungs to entertain one another and laugh your way into the day!	As soon as you wake up	 each of you think of a song that you know the melody of and at least the first few words. When you’ve got one	 ask your partner if they’re ready	 meaning “Are you now ready to start singing your song?” (Remember	 you do not need to know the entire song by heart	 only the beginning.) Don’t tell each other what your song is. Then	 one of you says	 “On your mark	 get set	 go!” (You can alternate this role from day to day.) On “Go!	” you both proceed to sing out your respective songs simultaneously to each other	 as authentically and in character with the original singer’s performance as you can. The more you ham it up	 the better! You’ll laugh your way into the day		1) Agree the night before on a song and do that song simultaneously. 2) Try learning an additional word or line each morning till you can both sing a song together in its entirety. 3) If you like your partner or child’s choice	 you can just join in and sing their song together. 4) Adults	 you can play this when you first meet in the shower together. Hence the name “shower song.” Or skip the shower and just do it when you first meet in the bathroom. 5) Parents and kids: Do it when you first meet at breakfast	 or in the car while driving. 6) See who can name the other person’s song first. 7) Do this when you call your partner or child on the phone. Make it the first thing you do after you say	 “HI!” In other words	 you say	 “Hi	 Are you ready?” And when they are	 you do the “on your mark	 get set	 go” routine.																		
4	dramatic	Three Shots (or The Gun Game)	Wavy Gravy	Waking up in the morning; going to bed at night	Shoot ‘Em Up! But do it quietly and unexpectedly	 by sneaking your way through the  day.	This game can be played any time of the day. You could even use it as an office game. And it certainly works as a “leaving or coming home” game	 because the whole idea is to surprise the people you shoot. They should never know when to expect it. Everyone has an invisible gun	 and everybody has three shots a day. You sneak up on people and pretend to shoot them	 and then they have to die the most dramatic death that they can imagine at that time	 coughing	 groaning	 flailing arms	 falling to the ground and gasping—the whole enchilada.				You can’t shoot if they’re carrying anything hot	 or breakable like a camera	 or if they’re doing an important job.																												
5	mental	Make up a Story		Waking up in the morning; going to bed at night	Try not to let your imagination run away with you	 as you pick up where the other player leaves off.	Just decide who starts	 and start telling a story one sentence (or one word) at a time. Each person says his or her sentence	 and then the other person picks up the story	 connecting as much as possible with the thought and character(s) of the previous sentence.		1) Let each person do three words only. 2) Once you’re both warmed up and into the swing of it	 and doing one sentence at a time	 try taking on different accents (Italian	 French	 German) or dialects (Brooklynese	 Southern). This will add a lot of humor to the proceeding and might also make it easier to get into the swing of things.		Don’t be judgmental: it’s is the worst enemy of creativity. Adults playing this game with children should be prepared for kids to come up with lots of stuff that is normally censored (for example	 references to various body excretions). Those have to come out	 pardon the pun	 if the creativity is going to come out.																										
6	dramatic	Surprise Wake-up Call	Carolyn Permentier	Waking up in the morning; going to bed at night	Make some one's day by surprising then with a call from the President or Madonna- whatever floats your boat.	Arrange with another family with whom you’re close to take turns giving each other wake-up calls. For example: wives call Mondays and Wednesdays; husbands call Tuesdays and Thursdays	 responsible kids call Fridays (this can be a reward for the kids). The idea is for the “waker” to pretend he or she is someone else like the president of the United States; Fidel Castro (if you can speak Spanish); Inspector Clouseau (if you can do a French accent); a very sexy admirer from the company the “wakee” works at (be careful with this one); the guy who’s trying to give you a free newspaper subscription (you of course make it the National Enquirer to add some pizazz); a market researcher doing a survey on whatever sensational topic you can imagine; that Publishers Clearinghouse Sweepstakes guy offering you a million bucks.		Pretend you’re one of the most famous people alive (or secretary thereof) within the occupation of the person you’re calling. For example	 if you’re waking up someone who is an stockbroker	 you could say you’re the assistant to the president of Merrill Lynch	 who’s heard about how well they’ve been performing and wants to offer them a position in New York. Or if you’re waking up an attorney	 you could say you’re Alan Dershowitz or his assistant. You got the idea.		Warning: Double-check that you are calling at the precise time when the “wakee” wants	 and not sooner or later. Slip ups could be detrimental to neighborly relations. This is probably not a game for \weekends	 when most people prefer waking up naturally																															
7	mental	Surprise Gift	Karen Ehrlich	Waking up in the morning; going to bed at night	A little goes a long way. Surprise loved ones by leaving small tokens of affection for them to find.	Sometime in the evening	 slip a love note or other surprise under your mate’s pillow. When you go to bed	 just tell them that there’s a surprise under their pillow.																																								
8	mental	The Alphabet Game	Bob Cambanes	Riding in the car; while walking; while biking	You’ll  have to mind your P’s and Q’s when playing this game. Choose a topic. Then take turns beginning each sentence with the letters of the alphabet	 from A  all the way to Z. 	Pick a topic and choose someone to start the conversation. Whoever starts talking has to start their sentence with the letter A. The next person has to start their sentence with the letter B	 the next with C	 and so on. It’s best to determine the order ahead of time	 say clockwise or counter clockwise	 so everyone gets a turn. You also should announce in advance that the X and Z are excluded	 and for the first two or three times	 maybe those stumpers Q and J as well. Decide if you want to make it competitive by giving points.		1) Give extra points if anyone (a) compliments the driver in their sentence; or (b) uses a real word that no other children her age or older can define. 2) Require that the each person start their sentence with the last letter of the last word of the person who spoke before them. 3) See how fast you can get through the alphabet	 and then try to beat your record	 offering a special reward if you do. 4) For more advanced players	 pick an object like water	 sun	 flowers	 dogs	 etc. and whatever you say	 you must make some reference to that object. So if you were about to say “After school let out	 I met Sally	” and the object for the game was “sun	” you might now say	 “After school let out	 I met Sally	 who has hair as bright and golden as the sun!” The person responsible for the letter B might respond: “But when I started to talk to her	 the sun was in my eyes.” 	And person C might respond	 “Carefully	 I bet	 you maneuvered yourself into another position that got the sun out of your eyes?”														
9	mental	Three Best Things	Michelle Ballew	Riding in the car; while walking; while biking	Whether you’re in a car	 on a boat	 train or plane- it’s always important to keep the positive energy flowing. Take turns naming the three best things that happened to you during your day (funny incidents included).	Very simple: While in the car or taking a walk	 just share	 taking turns	 the three best things that happened to you during your day. 		An added variation with this one rule: You can only ask two questions about each of the other person’s best things	 and they must ask at least two questions about  your three best things.   																																		
10	mental	Eight Best Things	Michelle Ballew	Riding in the car; while walking; while biking	A variation of the game “Three Best Things” take turns naming eight best things that happened to you during your day (funny incidents included)	While in the car or taking a walk	 just share	 taking turns	 the eight best things that happened to you during your day. This variation is especially powerful in forcing you to really start seeing and appreciating the small things that happen every day.																																							
11	mental	Last Letter First Letter		Riding in the car; while walking; while biking	Like a chain reaction	 one person says the name of a person	 place or thing and the next person does the same	 starting with the last letter of the previous person’s word. Definitely keeps the wheels turning.	Decide who starts and your order (clockwise or counterclockwise). Then whoever starts says the name of an historical figure (or animal	 flower	 food	 etc.)	 and the next person must say the name of another historical figure ( or animal	 etc.) that starts with the last letter of the previous person’s word. For example	 if the first person says “Martin Luther King	” the next person could say “Ghandi.” If the first person said “tiger	” the next person could say “raccoon.”																															
12	mental	Hinky Pinky	Bernie De Koven	Riding in the car; while walking; while biking	This is no tame game! Keep players guessing	 as you come up with a pair of rhyming words and describe it in a sentence or two.	This game uses charming rhyming word pairs you’ve only dreamed of creating. Okay	 this can be a very cute game. So please pardon a digression into momentary partial cuteness: Sly guys and gal pals! Let’s play a fun one! It’s not a tame game. Here’s the hot plot! Spot sees the hot plot! See the hot plot of Spot! See Spot go splot! No	 seriously. This game can be quite mentally challenging. Here’s how it works.  A Hinky Pinky is a noun-adjective pair that rhymes. A pair with one syllable is called a “Hink Pink” (nice mice	 hot pot	 fat cat); with two syllables	 it’s a Hinky Pinky (funny bunny	 pretty kitty); with three syllables	 it becomes a Hinkety Pinkety (merrier terrier). Hinkety Pinketies are	 of course	 the most challenging.  Whoever is “It” thinks of a pair of rhyming words and describes the pair in a sentence or two. The other players try to guess what the pair is. First to guess will be “It” next.  Being “It” is significant. 	Being “It” is life-impacting. Being “It” means you’ll be referred to for several minutes as a pronoun for inanimate	 sexless objects.    																														
13	physical	Slow Bike Race	Christine Lavin	Riding in the car; while walking; while biking	Just how slow can you go? Pedal your way towards the finish line as slowly as possible	 while staying on track- but there’s a catch...	Everybody’s done this game in some form	 but probably not on a bicycle. You did it when you were a kid	 remember? The object is to race	 not as fast as you can	 but as slow as you can. Whoever gets there last wins. I don’t recommend having more than one of these a day	 however. Trust me.  Pick out a goal	 or finish line marker	 about 100 feet away from your starting line. Anything will do: a tree	 parking meter	 wall	 or even a very lazy person who you’re sure won’t move. (Do not tell them why you chose them. Show tact and commend them for their patience.)  Give the signal: on your mark	 get set	 SLOW!  Each racer begins pedaling his or her bicycle toward the finish marker as slowly as possible without feet touching ground or falling over (or perhaps for beginners	 without feet touching ground or falling over more than two times). 	If those feet hit the ground	 that’s a stop	 and the stopper must immediately pedal one bike length forward (or you might try making it two bike lengths	 or most simply	 must bike one bike length in front of the most forward person). The last person to the finish marker wins.  Just as in life	 it will be considered unfair if you should lengthen your path by going astray. However	 just as in life	 it could also be more fun to go astray	 depending on where you stray to and who you stray with. I leave this rule in your hands	 since who is actually astray is a nasty tactical question at best.	1) The slow pogo stick race	 and for the truly gifted	 the slow unicycle race. 2) Try experimenting with the following handicaps	 especially if very young children with less developed balance ability are playing. Handicaps can be include slight pushes or tickles by family or friends who are watching	 or by mechanical means. Other possibilities include having to hold balloons under your armpits	 having to play a kazoo while racing	 or even having to hold a hard-boiled egg between your teeth without biting it in two.		Don’t play on the street or on heavily traveled sidewalks	 and be sure to wear knee and elbow guards if you’re prone to falling. Pushing or pulling your competition is not allowed. And don’t play if you have knee or muscular problems	 or any skeletal problems	 since falling off of a nearly stationary bicycle can still cause problems.						
14	mental	Read my Mind	Fred Schildmeyer	Riding in the car; while walking; while biking	 A picture may speak a thousand words...but only if you ask the right questions!	A person thinks of a mental picture and then everyone else asks the person questions till the picture can be guessed. The first person to guess the other’s picture wins whatever you all decide on. Example: You picture in your mind the cover of the “Lion King” book. Everyone else has to guess what you are seeing in your mind	 by asking questions such as: Person 1: “Is it outdoors or inside?” You say	 “Outdoors.” Person 2 : “ Is it city	 wilderness	 or rural?” You say	 “Wilderness.” Person 1: “Does it have a human	 an animal	 or only plants in it?” You get the point...		1) Everyone thinks of a picture simultaneously	 and everyone tries to guess everyone else’s picture. Of course you’ll need pen and paper to keep track of the clues. And whoever guesses a correct picture first gets the Big Reward.  2) Give your hints in creative ways	 for example	 by whistling a tune that provides a hint. For example	 if my picture is of myself singing in the rain	 or just being in the bathroom shower	 I could whistle “Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head	” or if I get desperate	 “Singing in the Rain.”  3) If you have four or more players (an even number is best)	 cut out various pictures from magazines and/or newspapers	 fold them and put them in a cup to be drawn later	 or just put them face down. Get into pairs like in the game Pictionary and then	 on the count of three	 have one person from each pair simultaneously look at one picture (one of those drawn from those cut out of the paper)	 and then go back to their partner and proceed to see which couple team can get the picture guessed first.  	Think of this as a “verbal Pictionary!”  4) Limit the field of choices to a picture (other than of a person) in the newspaper or a section thereof. This will help get the right answer much more quickly and make the game move much faster.																		
15	physical	Get Dressed Race (leaving)		Leaving and coming home	It’s a race to see who can get dressed and ready to leave the house first. (Under garments included)	Whoever is dressed and ready at the door to leave first gets a reward	 or whoever is first three out of five times in the week gets a grand reward. No cheating by skipping the undershirt/ underpants step. Couples might want to spot-check. Be aware that this could lead to a major delay in getting to work. The winner must also have had to comb their hair and brush their teeth. If the person’s head looks like they were struck by lightning	 they probably haven’t combed! If they breathe and you notice that the wallpaper begins to peel or if their heads are surrounded by flies	 or if the EPA puts caution cones around the house	 someone hasn’t brushed!				Use common sense. As a wise friend once warned me about haste: “Make haste slowly.” Otherwise	 you could fall	 trip	 or knock over something valuable.																															
16	physical	Clown Hug	Phyllis Greenleaf	Leaving and coming home	This silly show of affection will  have you doing a 360.	Explain what to do to the person you are hugging—this must be a two-way thing. Grasp arms completely around each other and hold on tight. Then jump up and down while spinning around	 making several 360-degree turns (agree on the direction beforehand)		1) Take turns making up sounds	 each imitating the other and joining in the other’s creation. 2) Alternate your direction each 360- degree turn. 3) Take turns mentioning something you love about the other person or are grateful for.																																						
17	mental	Moment of Truth		Leaving and coming home	Ignorance is not bliss	 in this “moment of truth”	It’s very simple. Before you can leave	 or before you can be let back home	 you must recite at least a one-sentence saying by a famous person (many of the shorter quotes in this book would do). You cannot use a saying you’ve already used. If someone has forgotten to learn a new saying	 they get an “ignorance point.” Whoever has the most ignorance points at the end of the week has to do some previously agreed-upon chore that nobody wants to do. Or conversely	 whoever has the least such points gets a special reward.		Instead of a famous one-line saying	 make it a joke.																																		
18	dramatic	New Neighbor (a.k.a Neighbor from Hell) (Coming home)		Leaving and coming home	Suspense lurks with every knock on your door as you and family members engage in “neighborhood theater.”	Just knock at the door pretending to be the new neighbor	 who’s really quite a character. Warn your partner or kids ahead of time	 since the suspense of waiting to see who you’re going to be is half the fun. The people answering the door should be nice and let the new neighbor in	 so they can get into their act right away. Here’s just a few ideas for how the new neighbor can be.		1) Be sure you knock on the door and truly do your best to act as if you are this made up person. 2) Whoever answers should do their best to neither completely oppose nor easily go along with the visitor. The most fun stance is usually that of being a very polite version of how you’d normally act in such a case. For example the advance persons	 you’d casually reveal stuff about you or your family (real or made up) that could embarrass the Pres. Whatever you do . . .	 do not out-and-out oppose the new neighbor	 otherwise the drama or action can’t develop further. 		To be safe	 you should always look through a window or peephole to make sure it’s really family before letting the “stranger” in. In other words	 be sure you exercise common sense. 																														
19	physical	Psychic Coming Home		Leaving and coming home	Can you guess when your loved one is a few seconds away from arriving home? Test your sixth sense to find out.	This game is especially for couples	 who live in safe neighborhoods or who can watch people approaching the door through peepholes or side windows. Unless your partner has a great memory	 warn them by phone just before coming home that you will be playing this game. The person who is home sees if they can open the door just before the person coming home actually touches the door handle. If you can	 you should get some previously agreed upon reward.				This game probably won’t be much of a challenge if you have a dog—at least if he or she is like our dogs																																			
20	mental	Last Letter/First Letter (coming home)  		Leaving and coming home	Open sesame! This game becomes a substitute for your house keys.	Warn the person at home just before coming home	 that you will be playing this game. Whoever comes to the door must knock and say something like	 “Hi! I’m home!” The person inside must then answer with a sentence starting with the last letter of the sentence that’s just been said	 in this case	 the letter e in “home.” So let’s say the person at home replies	 “Even though you’re home	 is not reason for me to open the door according to this game’s rules!” To which the person at the door must reply with a sentence starting with the letter S. The person inside has to open up the door when they can’t come up with a proper sentence within	 say	 ten seconds.		If you don’t want to be waiting at the door to get in	 just agree you’ll play as soon as you come in.																															
21	mental	Bookstore Game		While Shopping; while Eating Out	Educate one another by researching and sharing your new-found knowledge.	Each of you write down one or two of your favorite topics or questions on a slip of paper with your name on each slip. Fold and toss into a cup or hat and draw. If you get your own slip	 put it back and draw again until you get someone else’s. For the topic you get	 you attempt within an agreed-upon time limit (I suggest at least twenty minutes) to find one or two of the best books you can find	 and a paragraph or two within each book	 that specifically address the topic or question. Then meet back and proceed to read and inform each other.																																						
22	dramatic	Take My Seat Please	Chris Prey and Richard Brautigan	While Shopping; while Eating Out	This can make for an interesting rush hour ride.  See who can give up their seat to passengers the most number of times.	This game is best played with just two people. The object of the game is very simple: see who can give up their seat to passengers the most number of times. You can have a ball at this by just hamming it up. For example	 when Chris and Richard first played it	 and it got down to a situation where there was only one person standing	 they would both offer their seat to that person. Chris would compete by saying things like	 “You	 sir	 wouldn’t want to sit next to a hippie (referring to Brautigan’s long hair) would you? I think you’d much prefer my seat.” And Brautigan might counter in kind or just change the subject by saying	 “But sir	 by sitting in my seat you will be able to see the famous San Francisco Pyramid Building and St. John’s Cathedral.”		Take a walk around downtown when parking meters are enforced	 and spend a few nickels to save people parking tickets by putting them in expired meters. See who can use up their nickels first	 one nickel per meter																														
23	dramatic	Full Monty	Idea derived from the movie The Full Monty	While Shopping; while Eating Out	Put your choreography skills to use as you and other players make music together.	I particularly recommend this for groups of four or more people	 either combinations of parents with young children (but old enough to keep a rhythm)	 perhaps seven to ten	 or for teens to do on their own. Of course it could be a very romantic couple activity as well. First	 learn a simple routine together at home before going out. Pick a simple rhythmic pop hit that you all feel makes you want to tap your feet. Then develop a routine—a series of foot	 leg	 hand	 and arm moves that you all do simultaneously. The key is to keep it simple. I recommend starting with something that’s not too fast	 say about sixty beats per minute. Make your movements fairly subtle	 nothing too large or fast	 starting with very small movements with your index fingers	 or snapping on every other beat	 or just tapping your right foot to every beat of the rhythm	 placing it only a few inches out and to your right.	Get together just three or four steps and put them together in a systematic routine in a specific order	 for a certain number of beats per step	 say eight beats for each step. So one routine might be as follows: 8 beats: Start with your right foot turned outward and tapping to each count. 8 beats: Add to this right foot action the shaking of your right index finger (as if saying “naughty	 naughty!”) 8 beats: Keep the right foot tapping and now replace the right finger routine with a choo-choo train movement	 your right arm at a ninety degree angle	 hands flat	 thumbs up. 8 beats: Then just tap your right foot	 without any finger or arm action	 and repeat as above	 over and over for as long as you wish. If you have other young-at-hearts in the line	 you might just get a few to join. And the more that join	 the more likely more will follow.	When you get to the mall	 deliberately find a big line to stand in. The longer the line	 the better. Movies are great for this. Then try to space yourself	 so that you allow at least one or two persons to get between each of you. Be sure to agree that whoever is closest to the head of the line is the leader and everyone must follow them. When the leader starts	 you all follow	 but only one at time. Don’t all start up at once. In fact	 the idea here is to make it look to the others in the line that you are all getting into this routine independently	 each deciding	 after some hesitancy	 to just start imitating the one who started it all. By your not being together	 it will look spontaneous. In this atmosphere	 you just might start getting others in line to join in; they’ll be thinking that if all of you could be that spontaneous and unself-conscious	 why can’t they?				
24	dramatic	He Took My Menu!	Jack Lemmon	While Shopping; while Eating Out	You’re never too old to have imaginary friends	 right?	“Felicia [his wife] and I very often will improvise. The last time we did it	 we were at Sardi’s Restaurant. They thought we were a little crazy because we got carried away. We were sitting alone at a little table	 and there was nobody at the table on either side. So I suddenly said	 ‘Pretend that a guy sat down next to you	 we’re both reading the menu	 and I’m engrossed	 and this guy suddenly takes your menu	 and now you don’t have a menu and he proceeds to read it	 and order from it	 and you can’t get it back from him.’ Well we got into this thing with an imaginary guy at the next table. . . . This went on for another five minutes. I know it sounds crazy	 but the point is that you can have fun doing those things	 making up things together.”																														
25	physical	Department Store Hide-and-Seek	Pinky Zalkin	While Shopping; while Eating Out	For those of you who can’t stand shopping...this one’s for you!	Young children already play a version of this game when they get bored in large department stores. The game they play is more aptly named Which Clothes Rack Am I in the Middle of Now? And	 of course	 it is usually the clothes rack that has the most clothes on the floor around it.  When you play Department Store Hide-and-Seek	 you are following in the footsteps of all the greats: Laurel and Hardy	 The Three Stooges	 the Marx Brothers in The Big Store. Our version may not be quite as madcap	 but chances are you will garner a few strange looks from other shoppers. If this happens	 simply continue to act like you’re intently devoted to your secret mission	 look at the shopper	 and whisper “secret mission	” or “looking for a missing person.” Don’t say	 “looking for someone who’s hiding	” since they might get the wrong idea. Then slink away	 casting furtive glances as you go.  First	 before you begin	 you need to establish the floor that the person hiding has to stay on. 	This creates a fair arena of play and one where the game can be completed in a reasonable amount of time. After all	 you probably have to get up for work the next morning to make some money to come back to the store and actually buy something. Walk together around that floor a bit to decide where to hide (which of course you keep to yourself). If the floor is unusually large	 you should further limit yourselves to a side of the floor	 and agree on the landmarks that set the boundaries. Second	 as you walk around	 think of a clue to give the seeker before they close their eyes and you go off to hide. Third	 agree on what is to be the “safety” or “central” location	 the place where the seeker closes their eyes and does the counting	 and to where the “seekee” is supposed to return for safety before being tagged. Then set a time limit for the game	 say five minutes.	1) Keep track of the time it takes to find the hidden person. Have something at stake	 such as whoever takes the longest to find the other has to buy ice cream cones.  2) If	 after three or four minutes the seeker is having problems	 try the “alpha wolf” tracking method for giving clues. In a wolf pack	 the alpha wolf is the leader. When a wolf gets lost	 it howls	 the alpha wolf answers	 and the separated wolf knows what direction to head. The lost wolf howls and listens for the alpha wolf until reaching the pack.  So the seeker	 if frustrated	 can give a wolf howl and listen for a response.  The hidden person is required to howl back. The seeker then moves toward the direction of the hidden person	 perhaps howling once or twice more. (Let us hope you will find your quarry before store security throws a net over you and you are carted away.) If you prefer a more discreet signal	 you might agree upon a simple whistle	 or bring kazoos with you. There I go with the kazoos again.		Do not play this with children too young to get around a department store on their own without getting lost or in trouble. Exercise common sense. If the child is under twelve	 have them accompanied by an older child or adult (or by another parent	 if one is available). This “hiding together” can be very bonding.  I think it’s some sort of primeval thing.
